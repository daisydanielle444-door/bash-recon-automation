# bash-recon-automation
A custom Bash reconnaissance script built from scratch to automate domain lookups with color-coded output, OSINT tools, and a branded ASCII banner. This project highlights my hands-on Linux skills, scripting logic, and ability to build practical cybersecurity tools with clean structure and readable output.
